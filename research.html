    <h1>Research</h1>

    <p>My research focuses on Bayesian econometric methods, with an emphasis on their application to macroeconomic and financial market data.</p>

    <p>My current empirical work investigates the dynamic relationships between macroeconomic indicators and financial markets.</p>

    <p>I am particularly interested in VAR models and their extensions, such as panel VARs and functional VARs, while also exploring related methods including unobserved component models, mixed-frequency models, and order-invariant VARs.</p>

                    This paper develops a method to incorporate micro data, available as repeated cross-sections, into macro VAR models to understand the distributional effects of 
                         macroeconomic shocks at business cycle frequencies. The method extends existing functional VAR models by "looking within" the micro distribution to identify 
                         the degree to which specific types of micro units are affected by macro shocks. It does so by creating a pseudo-panel from the repeated cross-section and adding 
                         these pseudo individuals into the macro VAR. Jointly modeling the micro and macro data leads to a large (pseudo) VAR, and we use Bayesian methods to ensure 
                         shrinkage and parsimony. Our application revisits Chang et al. (2024) and compares their functional VAR-based distributional impulse response functions with our 
                         proposed pseudo VAR-based ones to identify what types of individuals' earnings are most affected by business-cycle-type shocks. We find that the individuals 
                         exhibiting the strongest positive cyclical sensitivity are those in the lower tail of the earnings distribution, particularly men and those without a college 
                         education, as well as young workers.

                    Financial markets are interconnected, with micro-currents propagating across global markets and shaping economic trends. This paper moves beyond traditional stock 
                         market indices to examine cross-sectional return distributions-15 in our empirical application, each representing a distinct global market. To facilitate this analysis,
                         we develop a matrix functional VAR method with interpretable factors extracted from cross-sectional return distributions. Our approach extends the existing framework 
                         from modeling a single function to multiple functions, allowing for a richer representation of cross-sectional dependencies. By jointly modeling these distributions 
                         with U.S. macroeconomic indicators, we uncover the predictive power of financial market in forecasting macro-economic dynamics. Our findings reveal that U.S. 
                         contractionary monetary policy not only lowers global stock returns, as traditionally understood, but also dampens cross-sectional return kurtosis, highlighting 
                         an overlooked policy transmission. This framework enables conditional forecasting, equipping policymakers with a flexible tool to assess macro-financial linkages 
                         under different economic scenarios.

                    Bayesian inference in Vector Autoregressions (VARs) involves manipulating large
                        matrices which appear in the posterior (or conditional posterior) of the VAR coefficients. For large VARs, the computational burden of these manipulations can render
                        empirical work impractical. In response to this, many researchers transform their
                        VARs so as to allow for Bayesian estimation to proceed one equation at a time. This
                        leads to a massive reduction in the computational burden. This transformation involves taking the Cholesky decomposition for the error covariance matrix. However,
                        this strategy implies that posterior inference depends on the order the variables enter the VAR. In this paper we develop an alternative transformation, based on the
                        eigendecomposition, which does not lead to order dependence. Beginning with an
                        inverse-Wishart prior on the error covariance matrix, we derive and discuss the properties of the prior it implies on the eigenmatrix and eigenvalues. We then show how
                        an extension of the prior on the eigenmatrix can allow for greater flexibility while
                        maintaining many of the benefits of conjugacy. We leverage this flexibility to extend the prior on the eigenvalues to allow for stochastic volatility. The properties
                        of the eigendecomposition approach are investigated in a macroeconomic forecasting
                        exercise involving VARs with 20 variables.
