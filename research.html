    <h1>Research</h1>

    <p>My research focuses on Bayesian econometric methods, with an emphasis on their application to macroeconomic and financial market data.</p>

    <p>My current empirical work investigates the dynamic relationships between macroeconomic indicators and financial markets.</p>

    <p>I am particularly interested in VAR models and their extensions, such as panel VARs and functional VARs, while also exploring related methods including unobserved component models, mixed-frequency models, and order-invariant VARs.</p>

                    This paper develops a method to incorporate micro data, available as repeated cross-sections, into macro VAR models to understand the distributional effects of 
                         macroeconomic shocks at business cycle frequencies. The method extends existing functional VAR models by "looking within" the micro distribution to identify 
                         the degree to which specific types of micro units are affected by macro shocks. It does so by creating a pseudo-panel from the repeated cross-section and adding 
                         these pseudo individuals into the macro VAR. Jointly modeling the micro and macro data leads to a large (pseudo) VAR, and we use Bayesian methods to ensure 
                         shrinkage and parsimony. Our application revisits Chang et al. (2024) and compares their functional VAR-based distributional impulse response functions with our 
                         proposed pseudo VAR-based ones to identify what types of individuals' earnings are most affected by business-cycle-type shocks. We find that the individuals 
                         exhibiting the strongest positive cyclical sensitivity are those in the lower tail of the earnings distribution, particularly men and those without a college 
                         education, as well as young workers.

                    Bayesian inference in Vector Autoregressions (VARs) involves manipulating large
                        matrices which appear in the posterior (or conditional posterior) of the VAR coefficients. For large VARs, the computational burden of these manipulations can render
                        empirical work impractical. In response to this, many researchers transform their
                        VARs so as to allow for Bayesian estimation to proceed one equation at a time. This
                        leads to a massive reduction in the computational burden. This transformation involves taking the Cholesky decomposition for the error covariance matrix. However,
                        this strategy implies that posterior inference depends on the order the variables enter the VAR. In this paper we develop an alternative transformation, based on the
                        eigendecomposition, which does not lead to order dependence. Beginning with an
                        inverse-Wishart prior on the error covariance matrix, we derive and discuss the properties of the prior it implies on the eigenmatrix and eigenvalues. We then show how
                        an extension of the prior on the eigenmatrix can allow for greater flexibility while
                        maintaining many of the benefits of conjugacy. We leverage this flexibility to extend the prior on the eigenvalues to allow for stochastic volatility. The properties
                        of the eigendecomposition approach are investigated in a macroeconomic forecasting
                        exercise involving VARs with 20 variables.

                    Interest in regional economic issues coupled with advances in administrative data is driving the creation of new regional economic data. Many of these data series 
                         could be useful for nowcasting regional economic activity, but they suffer from a short (albeit constantly expanding) time series which makes incorporating them 
                         into nowcasting models problematic. Regional nowcasting is already challenging because the release delay on regional data tends to be greater than that at the 
                         national level, and “short” data imply a “ragged edge” at both the beginning and the end of regional data sets, which adds a further complication. In this paper, 
                         via an application to the UK, we investigate various ways of including a wide range of short data into a regional mixedfrequency VAR model. These short data include 
                         hitherto unexploited regional VAT turnover data. We address the problem of the ragged edge at both the beginning and end of our sample by estimating regional factors 
                         using different missing data algorithms that we then incorporate into our mixed-frequency VAR model. We find that nowcasts of regional output growth are generally 
                         improved when we condition them on the factors, but only when the regional nowcasts are produced before the national (UK-wide) output growth data are published.

                     In this paper, we assess whether and when multi-country studies pay off for
                         forecasting inflation and output growth. Factor stochastic volatility is adopted to allow
                         for cross-country linkages and model economies jointly. We estimate factors and rely on
                         the post-processing, rather than expert judgement, to obtain an estimate for the number of
                         factors. This is different from most existing two-step approach in the factor literature. Our
                         approach is then used to extend the existing unobserved components model which assumes 34
                         economies are independent. The results suggest that allowing for cross-country linkages yields
                         inflation and output growth forecasts that are highly competitive to estimating economies
                         independently. Zooming into the forecast performance over time reveals that allowing for
                         cross-country linkages is of particular importance when interest centers on forecasting periods
                         of uncertainty. Another key finding is that the estimated global factors are correlated with
                         the domestic business cycle. We interpret this as that part of the variation captured in global
                         factors reflects a global business cycle.

                     Increased globalization and trade have integrated the world, but whether they are the underlying drivers of the flattening of the Phillips curve slope is not clear. This 
                         problem is further complicated since time-varying parameters are empirically important in most applications
                         as the role of global factors may change over time. This paper investigates empirically the
                         role played by global and domestic factors in driving dynamics in inflation using a panel
                         data comprising of 23 advanced (AEs) and 11 emerging market economies (EMEs), from
                         1995Q1 to 2018Q1. The results indicate the predominance and increasing importance of
                         global factors in explaining inflation dynamics, especially for EMEs. The Phillips curve is
                         flat for both groups, but it is flatter in AEs. The results are consistent with the theoretical
                         view that increased globalization and trade are underlying factors behind the flattening of
                         the Phillips curve.
